# pymaceuticals-challenge
## Instructions
This project utilized what we've learned in Matplotlib to generate all the tables and figures needed for Pymaceuticals Inc, a company specializing in anti-cancer medication. We were given data results from their most recent study in which they identified 249 mice with SCC tumor growth and gave them treatment through a variety of drug regimens. Pymaceuticals drug of interest, Capomulin, was compared to other treatment regimens. Over the course of 45 days, tumor development was observed and measured. 

##Tasks
Import and display the number of unique mice IDs. Check the data for any IDs with duplicate time points and remove any data associated with that mouse ID. Clean the data and display the updated number of unique mice IDs in a new DataFrame.
